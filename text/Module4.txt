functions


functions are defined with a name, parameters and or a return type and the final body of code, the return statement is optional like python. the arguments passed in the functions definition may or may not be passed

overloading a function referes the referencing multiple functions under the same name, for the sake of increased functionality, this is a more advanced feature though
multiple functions may be defined under the same name, but have different arguments passed to them, therefore it is the job of the compiler to determine which parameters were passed to call the function, and accordingly choose which of the functions to return

e.g. this example
```
int sum(int x, int y) //first sum function
{
    int val;
    val = x + y;
    cout << val << endl;
    return x + y;
}

int sum(int x, int y, int z) //second sum function
{
    return x + y + z;
}


int main()
{
    return sum(3, 4);
}

```

here the first sum function is called given it contains two arguments, and the main functions calls a sum function will two parameters
if the return statement were to contain three integer parameters, the second would be called

the functions storage class, return type, name, parameters are called it function prototype
this function definition exists in the source code

inline functions


you preface the creation of an inline function by using the 'inline' keyword
an inline functions is more efficient in the code, this is because it is more memory efficient, and does away with the typical calling of a function

```
inline void swap(int i, int j)
{
    int temp = i;
    i = j;
    j = temp;
}
int main()
{
    swap(3, 4);
    return 0;
}
```

here the inline function 'swap' has been made with initialised variables 'i' and 'j'

the calling of this function in the main function is where the compiler simply places the code from the inline function using the arguments given

- the compiler may ignore your request for the inline function and call it normally
- use inline functions for small pieces of code, not huge operations
